**Form Validation Website**
->This is a simple web project that demonstrates real-time form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Features**
->Real-time validation for:
->Name field — required and must contain only letters.
->Email field — required and must be in valid email format.
->Password field — required and must be at least 6 characters long.
->Displays custom error messages for each field.
->Submit button is disabled until all fields are valid.
->Real-time feedback as the user types (form responds immediately).
->After successful submission, displays a confirmation alert and resets the form.

**How It Works**
->The project uses an input or keyup event listener on the form.
->Built-in regular expressions are used to validate:
->Name
->Email
->Password length
->A flag (validation) determines whether to enable/disable the submit button.
->The form prevents submission if there are any errors.
->The project is designed to help users understand how to implement custom form validation using JavaScript.

**Technologies Used**
->HTML5
->CSS3 (basic styling for the form and error messages)
->JavaScript (custom validation logic and real-time updates)

**Usage**
->Clone or download this repository.
->Open the HTML file in a modern web browser.
->Fill in the form fields:
->Name must be filled with letters only.
->Email must be a valid email format (example@gmail.com).
->Password must be at least 6 characters.
->Once all fields are valid, the submit button will be enabled.
->Click "Submit" to display a success message and clear the form.
